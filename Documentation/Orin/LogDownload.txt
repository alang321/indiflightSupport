we need to have absolute hygiene about mounting/unmounting stuff.

1. disable automounting when in ubuntu's desktop environment. Connected disks will still be shown in the file manager, but you have to click before they mount, which seems a good compromise.
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount false
```
2. make it possible for the user to run sudo commands without providing a password. Add a file `/etc/sudoers.d/mounting` with contents:
```
droneracing ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
