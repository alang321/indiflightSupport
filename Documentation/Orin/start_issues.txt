# The following things I did, but didnt have a big or even measurable effect on cold-to-wifi boot time

1. Disable dnsmasq, because another dnsmasq is provided within NetworkManager, it's a clusterfck
```
sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq
```
2. Switch from Hotspot to connecting to another Access Point (change the autostart option in `/etc/NetworkManager/something/something`
3. Set the 5 second UEFI timeout to 0 in the UEFI boot menu. This saved 5 seconds.
4. Disable the system console `sudo systemctl disable getty@tty1.service`
5. Disable the system console in the kernel commandline (remove `console=ttyTCU0,115200` from entries in /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf)
	- this felt like it saved some time, but probably not much

Currently, cold-to-home-screen takes around 45 seconds, cold-to-wifi takes 100.


# Compile new Wifi-drivers.

I saw we have similar behaviour to `https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/jetpack-6-wifi-slow-startup-with-backport-iwlwifi-dkms/297967/8` with the same drivers. The solution in that thread was to backport a later version of either the kernel or the drivers. I dont know how to compile kernels for the jetson (even though that sounds like the cleaner solution), so drivers it is:

The steps verbatim from `dandelion1124`'s answer (although i chose `backports-5.15.153-1.tar.xz`, a newer backport):

> At first, I download backports-5.15.81-1.tar.xz from https://backports.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Releases 28.
> I installed backports-iwlwifi from source code.

```
tar Jxfv backports-5.15.81-1.tar.xz
cd backports-5.15.81-1
make defconfig-iwlwifi
make -j8
sudo make install
```

> I add the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf.

```
options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1
```

> And, I reboot OS.
